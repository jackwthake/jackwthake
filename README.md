## Hi, I'm Jack

I build high-performance systems software in C/C++ - from **3D renderers that run on ARM microcontrollers** to **multithreaded HTTPS servers built from POSIX sockets**. I love working close to the hardware and understanding how things work at the lowest level.

**Currently seeking entry-level roles** in systems programming, embedded software development, or game engine engineering.

### Featured Projects

**[shader-works](https://github.com/jackwthake/shader-works)** - Software 3D renderer with zero dependencies
Complete CPU-based graphics pipeline in pure C. Renders 3000+ triangles at 40 FPS without a GPU. Successfully ported to ARM Cortex-M4 microcontroller (200MHz, 192KB RAM) with fully functional voxel world demo.

**[secure-serve](https://github.com/jackwthake/secure-serve)** - Production-ready HTTPS web server in modern C++
Built entirely from raw POSIX sockets with OpenSSL encryption, dynamic thread pooling, and smart pointer memory management. Features whitelist-based routing and exception-safe resource handling.

**[Tiny-Serial](https://github.com/jackwthake/Tiny-Serial)** - Lightweight serial monitor for embedded debugging
Minimal alternative to screen/minicom written in 140 lines of strict ANSI C89. Non-blocking bidirectional communication with graceful signal handling.
