## Hi, I'm Jack

I'm a software developer based in Portland, Oregon, focused on **low-level programming** and building systems from scratch. I'm interested in everything from graphics rendering to embedded systems - anything that gets close to the hardware.

### What I'm working on

**[shader-works](https://github.com/jackwthake/shader-works)** - High-performance 3D graphics pipeline written in C11, cross-platform and built for efficiency  
**[secure-serve](https://github.com/jackwthake/secure-server)** - Multithreaded web server in C++17 with HTTPS support  
**[Tiny-Serial](https://github.com/jackwthake/tiny-Serial)** - Minimal terminal based serial monitor for Arduino and embedded development

I studied Computer Science at Portland State University. Check out my [coursework repository](https://github.com/jackwthake/psu-computer-science) to see the projects I completed there.
