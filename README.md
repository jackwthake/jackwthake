## Hi, I'm Jack 👋

I'm a software developer based in Portland, Oregon, focused on **low-level programming** and building systems from scratch. I'm interested in everything from graphics rendering to embedded systems - anything that gets close to the hardware.

### What I'm working on

🎨 **[shader-works](https://github.com/jackwthake/shader-works)** - High-performance 3D graphics pipeline written in C11, cross-platform and built for efficiency  
🎮 **[tundra](link-here)** - An experimental FPS game built with my custom rendering engine  
🌐 **[Web-Server](https://github.com/jackwthake/Web-Server)** - Multithreaded web server in C with HTTPS support  
⚡ **[Tiny-Serial](link-here)** - Minimal serial monitor for Arduino and embedded development

I studied Computer Science at Portland State University. Check out my [coursework repository](https://github.com/jackwthake/psu-computer-science) to see the projects I completed there.

### Tech I work with
C • C++ • Systems Programming • Embedded Systems • 3D Graphics
